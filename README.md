# Monocle Giraffe
Mostly Unfinshied Imgur Lurking Client for Windows

##What is this?
This is a Windows UWP app for Imgur. Also it's mostly unfinished. You're welcome to make a fork and send some pull requests. You're also welcome to use the code and build an app (or a car). I'd appreciate if you give me some credit. Stay in touch, at very least. I'd like to know that someone is using the code.

##How to use this?
Clone this repo. It contains code for the app. It also contains a submodule for C# Imgur SDK - [SharpImgur](https://github.com/akshay2000/SharpImgur). If git fails to clone the submodule, run `git submodule update --init`. That should give you the whole source code. From there it's just a matter of launching and deploying the solution.

##It's ugly!
It's called unfinished for a reason. It's, you know, not finished. (Duh!)
